# HashCheckerSHA256
Swiftly verify the authenticity of your files!<br>
<br>
With this Graphical Interface you can easily compare SHA-256 Checksums of your files.<br>
This can be used help to ensure you are downloading safe software free of trojans.<br>
<br>
This tool features highlighting the differences between checksums.<br>
It can tell the user whether their checksums match or not, and where they fail to match.<br>


It has 3 states relating to the checksums.<ul>
<li>1 - "INVALID"  - This will appear if you are just checking the value of the files checksum with no comparator.</li>
<li>2 - "MATCH"    - This will appear if the checksum of the file matches the entered checksum.</li>
<li>3 - "MISMATCH" - This will appear if the checksum of the file does not match the entered checksum.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Here is a demo of how it works!
